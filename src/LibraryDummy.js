  body: "There was a boy who lived in a cave. He was very lonely and wished for a girlfriend. \n A magical fairy came into the cave one day. The fairy was a big testosterone emmitting man with the name Louie. He threw the boy a magic internet box calling it stupid nerd shit and promptly left. \n The boy used the magic box and tried to find someone to fill his loneliness. As much as he tried he couldn\'t find a suitable member of the opposite gender. \n He searched up and down, left and right, .com and .net, even .pizza and .ninja. He searched the entire world wide web and even the dark web. \n He searched and searched and searched. Then he searched in the last place he could think of. He searched within himself. He realized that the answer was within himself. With a grin, and newly gained knowledge, he named his right hand Vanessa and his left hand Stephanie. With his two new companions, he went off to bed to get to know them. Bibically."

body: "Once there was a coder. This coder was big and strong. He was known as the strongest coder in the world. How did he achieve this? In his own words: \n Once my superior wasn't accepting my branch and I got frustrated so I used my height to intimidate him so he would merge my code into the master branch. I am not proud of this but thats what happun. Also another co worker was talking mad crap about python. I love python. I took it personally so I punched him so hard his nose inverted. I then picked him up and bench pressed him. My boss was so impressed that he began spotting me. We high fived so hard we needed to type our code with one hand for a month. It was very metal. "

body: "Why do we daydream? As a child maybe we may chalk it up to exploring and roleplay. People do not tend to outgrow this behabior although it morphs into different forms. \n Such desires are a product of our surroundings. Put a person in a situation where they lack a necessity and their fantasies become flooded with that which is missing. Starving people see hallucinations of food. Lost wanderes see mirages of oasis in a desert. Unfullfilled people lust for power, money or even sex. \n What of children in the modern age? We can explain a person's fantasy through their surroundings. To live in a society, nothing seemingly changes, there's no danger, institutions around you are trying to mold you into a tool to support itself. The fantasy becomes to become unique, for life to validate you in some way, to fight a battle in which there's an enemy in which you may dedicate yourself into destroying. \n In a sense this may be the source of a pendulum of sorts. The mechanism of a society not fullfilling or being unable to fulfill the needs of every individual."
